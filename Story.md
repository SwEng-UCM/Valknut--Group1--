###### Intro



For The Viking Warriors the greatest honor upon death was to enter Valhalla, the Hall of Heroes. This is a majestic hall located in Asgard and presided over by the god Odin where our heroes will live untill Ragnarök when they will march out of its many doors to fight in aid of Odin against the jötnare, the ice giants.



To enter Valhalla you need to die in heroic battle with a weapon in hand. Your goal is to find a weapon and a worthy enemy to send you to the Hall of Heroes.
